Can your little one exercise? Yes of course! Babies, also need exercise, you know, Mums. Regular exercise has an important developmental impact on children's health later in life. Infancy and toddlerhood are times when the brain develops pathways and connections to muscles. Children who don't get enough exercise can miss the opportunity to make the brain-muscle connection stronger. This brain connection is what makes physical activity easier and more enjoyable. If sports are introduced from childhood, when they grow up, children will consider exercise as a good habit that must be done for life.

Lori Rosello, MD, a pediatrician in private practice in New York says, "If children enjoy exercise from infancy, they will be more active as adults. Babies' brains that have been introduced to physical skills, will find it useful as motor stimulation pleasant." Over time, continued Rosello, children who are introduced to sports from infancy and continue to get used to exercising into adulthood are less likely to become obese. â€œOf course, when discussing the potential for obesity, we cannot ignore the genetic and environmental influences that each child has. However, the habit of instilling exercise from an early age can offer a kind of healthy lifestyle that can protect children from obesity later in life, "said Rosello. This is the main goal of the importance of instilling the habit of exercising in your little one, even since he was a baby.

Then, how to start this good habit? Check it out, to get to know more about the benefits of exercise and simple tricks for Mums to exercise with your little one at home!

Start Sports from Simple Things
The first thing you can do to introduce the importance of exercise is very simple. Reporting from webmd.com, according to pediatric experts, parents should not spend too many hours every day using a stroller, a small play area and the surroundings are fenced off like a playpen, and a car seat. This habit, if done continuously on an excessive scale, can have a bad impact because it can delay the child's physical and mental development.

"The need to be physically active from infancy is an important issue that all parents should understand," says Jane Clark, PhD, professor and chair of the department of kinesiology at the University of Maryland.
"Infants, toddlers and preschoolers who were previously stimulated by physical exercise and exercise on a daily basis, will develop better health as they grow older," Clark continued.

So, start by motivating your little one to do physical activities that don't limit their range of motion for a long time in everyday life. Inform family members at home so that all are united in realizing the importance of inviting your little one to play and move actively.

Sports Recommendations for Babies
Still reported from webmd.com, the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) recommends that parents or caregivers should place the baby in a situation that can encourage him to do physical activity and do not limit the baby's movement for a long time. Frequently leaving the baby alone in bed or in a chair can hinder a child's physical and mental development.

According to health information from health.gov.au, several choices of physical activity recommended for infants aged 0-1 years, including:

* Reaching and grasping movements.
* Pull and push motion.
* Move the head and body.
* Play on the floor, including tummy time.

All of these activities can help the baby's development, but make sure your little one is fully under the supervision of Mums and family when doing this movement, yes.

Good Exercise Movement Tutorial for Baby Development
Even though there are currently so many places that provide sports and gym facilities for babies, you don't need to worry. Mums are very able to do baby sports with their little ones from home. The following is a tutorial guide for movements that you can try to do with your little one.

For babies aged 0-6 months

* Finger towing movement. Place the baby in the bed in a supine position. Then put your two forefingers in your baby's hands. When your little one holds your index finger, lift the baby's hand up and slowly lift the baby. Then, slowly return the baby to its original position. The tighter your baby grips your index finger, the better his motor sensors are. Make sure you are careful when lifting your little one. Adjust this move to his abilities. Your little one may be able to do this movement at around 6 weeks of age.
* Bike movement. Place the baby on his back in his crib. Hold and lift your little one's legs up to form a 90 degree angle. Then, gently push one of the baby's legs toward his chest, leaving the other leg free. Then, move the baby's legs alternately, just like the movement of pedaling a bicycle.
* Tummy time. This movement is very simple. Mums only need to place your little one in a prone position for about 3-5 minutes. This movement is beneficial for building neck, arm, shoulder, back, and abdominal muscles. At around two months of age, your baby may respond to this movement by trying to lift his head. As for older babies, this movement will help him as a first step to learning to crawl slowly.

For babies aged 6-12 months

* Foot movements. Place the baby on his back, then raise his legs straight. Push the baby's right leg straight toward the baby's left ear, keep the other leg straight, and return the baby's leg to its full position. Do this movement alternately with the other leg.
* Elbow stand movement. Place the baby face down and position the baby's arms bent at the side of the baby's shoulders. Slowly lift the baby's hips until they are 45 degrees to the floor. Let the baby's hands rest on the floor and make sure the baby's head is facing to the side. Try to lift the baby's legs even higher.
