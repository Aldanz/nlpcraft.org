What's even more interesting is that fatigue levels in the low-intensity exercise group dropped more than the higher-intensity group, great news for those who may have missed a workout because they didn't have the time or energy for a more intense session.

Both groups reported experiencing a steady increase in energy over the six-week period of the experiment. So, the benefits of exercise for the body are quite effective for increasing energy.

6. Boost immunity
Strengthening the immune system to fight cancer in the future to reduce the risk of breast cancer, the benefits of regular exercise can help protect the body.

Exercising just 10 minutes a day, or 75 minutes a week, can give you an extra 1.8 years of life. This finding holds true even for people who are overweight or obese; adding exercise helped them live longer, while obesity and inactivity lowered life span by up to 7.2 years.

The benefits of adding more exercise increased and then increased by about 300 minutes of exercise weekly (or one hour five days a week) adding an additional 4.2 years of life.

10. Lowers cholesterol
The benefits of exercising help the body move and burn calories so that it produces the energy the body needs to work. It also helps the body reduce fat accumulation in the body.

Regular exercise can also burn LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides and increase HDL (good cholesterol) levels. This greatly helps the body stay fit and reduces the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, and heart disease.

To understand the effects of exercise on weight loss, it is important to understand the relationship between exercise and energy expenditure.

Your body spends energy in three ways: digesting food, exercising and maintaining bodily functions such as heart rate and breathing.

When on a diet, reducing calorie intake will lower the body's metabolic rate, which will delay weight loss. On the other hand, the benefits of regular exercise have been shown to increase the metabolic rate, which will burn more calories and aid in weight loss.

In addition, studies have shown that combining aerobic exercise with resistance training can maximize fat loss and increase muscle mass, which is essential for maintaining weight loss.
